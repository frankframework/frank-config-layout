# CONTRIBUTING.md

Thanks for reading how to contribute to the frank-config-layout project. This is a first draft - not complete yet.

# How to build and test

Building and serving this project is done at the root folder of this project: `npm build` and the other scripts of the root's `package.json`.

The library code is tested by first building the code from the project root. Then go to `<root>/projects/frank-config-layout`. Do `npx ng test` there.
